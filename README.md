# Project Assignment 2: Button Web Component

During this Project Assignment, you will get your first taste of creating a web component. First, follow the steps in the section Create a Web Components Repository.1

Create a components directory inside of your web-components repository.
Inside of the newly created components directory, add another directory with the name buttons.
Inside of this buttons folder, create two new files named index.html and button.css.
Inside of index.html, add the following HTML:


Note that each element inside of the body tag in the sample above has the button class.1

Inside of button.css, write the ruleset(s) that will style all elements with the button class to be visually and functionally identical. To succeed, you will need to apply properties to negate the default properties of an element.

Experiment with color combinations, the thickness of borders and paddings, and any other properties that have an impact on the overall aesthetics of the buttons.

Also, style the hover and active states using pseudo-classes.

Style the classes button-sm, button-md, and button-lg to represent buttons of different sizes.
Your .button class should have the property and value display: inline-block;.
